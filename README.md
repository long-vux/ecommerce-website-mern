# ecommerce-website-mern

This is an exciting e-commerce website built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). This project marks my first venture into Node.js development after learning the basics, and it showcases several exciting features designed to enhance the online shopping experience.

# Features

- User Authentication: Secure login and registration system using JWT.
- Product Management: Admin functionality to add, edit, delete, and view products with detailed information.
- Shopping Cart: Users can add items to the cart, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout.
- Order Processing: Manage orders, track order status, and handle payments.
- Admin Dashboard: An interface for administrators to manage products, orders, and user data efficiently.
- Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices to ensure a seamless user experience.

# Technologies Used

- MongoDB: For storing product, user, and order information.
- Express.js: To build the server-side logic.
- React: For building a dynamic and responsive user interface.
- Node.js: To execute server-side code.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
